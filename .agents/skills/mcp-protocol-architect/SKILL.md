  Use for designing or refactoring MCP server surfaces around protocol primitives, transport
  choices, lifecycle, capability negotiation, discovery, notifications, and tool/resource/prompt
  boundaries. Trigger when the user asks how an MCP feature should be modeled; when to use a tool
  vs resource vs prompt; how clients should discover or react to changes; how to structure a
  protocol surface; or how to choose transports and capabilities cleanly. Do not use for ordinary
  Python refactors or low-level performance work.
when_to_use: >
  Especially useful for primitive selection, protocol correctness, lifecycle design, transport
  decisions, notifications, and long-term MCP API shape.

# MCP Protocol Architect

Design the protocol surface first. Choose the right primitive, define the lifecycle, and only
then worry about the server implementation.

## Core Rule

Model the user-facing workflow before writing code.

- Tools are model-invoked actions with typed inputs.
- Resources are passive context the application reads.
- Prompts are reusable user-invoked interaction templates.

## Design Sequence

1. Name the workflow the user is trying to accomplish.
2. Split the workflow into primitive-sized responsibilities.
3. Decide what changes over time and what stays stable.
4. Choose the transport that matches deployment reality.
5. Define discovery, visibility, and notification behavior.
6. Only then map the design to server implementation.

## Protocol Guidance

### Primitive Selection

- Use a tool when the model should invoke an action or computation.
- Use a resource when the client should fetch browseable or passive data.
- Use a prompt when the user needs a reusable guided workflow.
- Keep static data out of tools when a resource fits better.
- Do not use prompts to hide a broken API surface.

### Lifecycle And Capabilities

- Respect initialization and capability negotiation.
- Model dynamic surfaces explicitly.
- Use list operations plus change notifications when components can appear or disappear.
- Prefer stable component keys and naming.

### Discovery And Visibility

- Make component discovery explicit.
- If a surface is filtered or role-based, model that up front.
- Dynamic catalogs should advertise changes instead of relying on clients to guess.

### Transport

- Use stdio for local subprocess workflows and single-host integrations.
- Use Streamable HTTP when remote access, auth, or shared serving is required.
- Treat SSE as legacy compatibility rather than the default.
- Do not choose a transport just because it sounds modern.

## Output Expectations

Return:

1. primitive mapping
2. lifecycle and capability notes
3. transport recommendation
4. discovery and notification plan
5. implementation implications
6. tradeoffs and rejected alternatives

## Anti-Patterns

- treating everything as a tool
- using prompts to patch bad primitive design
- ignoring capability negotiation
- designing remote-first when the deployment is local-first
- confusing client-driven resources with model-driven tools
- skipping notifications for dynamic catalogs
